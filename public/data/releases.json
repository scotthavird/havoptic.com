Learn More - Steer mode is now stable and enabled by default, so Enter sends immediately during running tasks while Tab explicitly queues follow-up input. (10690) Bug Fixes - Fixed resumeThread() argument ordering in the TypeScript SDK so resuming with local images no longer starts an unintended new session. (10709) - Fixed model-instruction handling when changing models mid-conversation or resuming with a different model, ensuring the correct developer instructions are applied. (10651, 10719) - Fixed a remote compaction mismatch where token pre-estimation and compact payload generation could use different base instructions, improving trim accuracy and avoiding context overflows. (10692) - Cloud requirements now reload immediately after login instead of requiring a later refresh path to take effect. (10725) Chores - Restored the default assistant personality to Pragmatic across config and related tests/UI snapshots.

      "fullNotes": "New Features - API v2 threads can now inject dynamic tools at startup and route their calls/responses end-to-end through the server and core tool pipeline. (9539) - Added filtering on the thread list in the app server to make large thread sets easier to browse. (9897) - Introduced a thread/unarchive RPC to restore archived rollouts back into active sessions. (9843) - MCP servers can now define OAuth scopes in config.toml, reducing the need to pass --scopes on each login. (9647) - Multi-agent collaboration is more capable and safer, with an explorer role, better collab event mapping, and max-depth guardrails. (9817, 9818, 9918, 9899) - Cached websearch is now the default client behavior. (9974) Bug Fixes - Fixed a TUI deadlock/freeze under high streaming throughput by avoiding blocking sends on the main Tokio thread. (9951) - The websearch tool now handles and displays all action types, and shows in-progress activity instead of appearing stuck. (9960) - Reduced high CPU usage in collaboration flows by eliminating busy-waiting on subagents. (9776) - Fixed codex resume --last --json so prompts parse correctly without conflicting argument errors. (9475) - Windows sandbox logging now handles UTF-8 safely, preventing failures when truncating multibyte content. (8647) - requestuserinput is now rejected outside Plan/Pair modes to prevent invalid tool calls. (9955) Documentation - Updated the contribution guidelines for clearer onboarding and workflow expectations. (9933) - Refreshed protocol/MCP docs to reflect thread/unarchive and the updated requestuserinput question shape. (9843, 9890) Chores - Self-update via Homebrew now uses an explicit cask upgrade command to avoid warnings and ambiguity. (9823) - Release packaging now consistently writes the bundle zip to dist/.

(8866) - Expose requirements via requirement/list so clients can read requirements.toml and adjust agent-mode UX. (8800) - Introduce metrics capabilities with additional counters for observability. (8318, 8910) - Add elevated sandbox onboarding with prompts for upgrade/degraded mode plus the /elevate-sandbox command. (8789) - Allow explicit skill invocations through v2 API user input. (8864) Bug Fixes - Codex CLI subprocesses again inherit env vars like LDLIBRARYPATH/DYLDLIBRARYPATH to avoid runtime issues. As explained in 8945, failure to pass along these environment variables to subprocesses that expect them (notably GPU-related ones), was causing 10x+ performance regressions! Special thanks to @johnzfitch for the detailed investigation and write-up in 8945. (8951) - /review <instructions> in TUI/TUI2 now launches the review flow instead of sending plain text. (8823) - Patch approval “allow this session” now sticks for previously approved files. (8451) - Model upgrade prompt now appears even if the current model is hidden from the picker. (8802) - Windows paste handling now supports non-ASCII multiline input reliably. Special thanks to @occurrent laying the groundwork for this fix in 8021! (8774) - Git apply path parsing now handles quoted/escaped paths and /dev/null correctly to avoid misclassified changes. (8824) Documentation - App-server README now documents skills support and usage. (8853) - Skill-creator docs clarify YAML frontmatter formatting and quoting rules.

Thanks to @cnaples79 who contributed the [core part](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/4017) of this fix!\n  - Cloud exec: codex cloud exec accepts --branch for remote runs and now exposes status/diff/apply flows so you can inspect and apply changes from the cloud path (#7602, #7614).\n  - Signing: Linux artifacts are signed via sigstore. (#7674).\n  - General fixes: parallel tool-call chat now returns correctly, ghost snapshot tokens aren’t billed, missing tool names no longer crash the litellm proxy, and migration prompts use HTTPS links\n    (#7634, #7638, #7724, #7705).\n\n\n### PRs Merged\n\n  - #6793 FIX: WSL Paste image does not work @Waxime64\n  - #6846 feat(core) Add login to shell_command tool @dylan-hurd-oai\n  - #6918 Add Enterprise plan to ChatGPT login description @ae-openai\n  - #7033 whitelist command prefix integration in core and tui @zhao-oai\n  - #7310 Inline response recording and remove process_items indirection @aibrahim-oai\n  - #7515 fix(apply-patch): preserve CRLF line endings on Windows @dylan-hurd-oai\n  - #7543 execpolicy tui flow @zhao-oai\n  - #7544 Refactor execpolicy fallback evaluation @zhao-oai\n  - #7547 Use shared check sandboxing @pakrym-oai\n  - #7554 chore(core): test apply_patch_cli on Windows @dylan-hurd-oai\n  - #7561 Do not emit start/end events for write stdin @pakrym-oai\n  - #7563 Slightly better status display for unified exec @pakrym-oai\n  - #7567 chore(apply-patch) scenarios for e2e testing @dylan-hurd-oai\n  - #7571 remove model_family from `config @aibrahim-oai\n  - #7580 feat: update sandbox policy to allow TTY @jif-oai\n  - #7583 Fix handle_shortcut_overlay_key for cross-platform consistency @448523760\n  - #7588 chore: default warning messages to true @jif-oai\n  - #7591 chore: tool tip for /prompt @jif-oai\n  - #7592 fix: release session ID when not used @jif-oai\n  - #7593 chore: review in read-only @jif-oai\n  - #7594 fix: sse for chat @jif-oai\n  - #7595 Update execpolicy.md @zhao-oai\n  - #7602 add --branch to codex cloud exec @nornagon-openai\n  - #7603 Add models endpoint @aibrahim-oai\n  - #7605 fix(app-server): add duration_ms to McpToolCallItem @owenlin0\n  - #7609 feat: exec policy integration in shell mcp @zhao-oai\n  - #7610 fix: taking plan type from usage endpoint instead of thru auth token @zhao-oai\n  - #7611 fix(app-server): add will_retry to ErrorNotification @owenlin0\n  - #7614 cloud: status, diff, apply @nornagon-openai\n  - #7615 chore: refactor to move Arc<RwLock> concern outside exec_policy_for @bolinfest\n  - #7616 Call models endpoint in models manager @aibrahim-oai\n  - #7617 fix: add integration tests for codex-exec-mcp-server with execpolicy @bolinfest\n  - #7620 Fix unified_exec on windows @pakrym\n  - #7621 Wire with_remote_overrides to construct model families @aibrahim-oai\n  - #7626 fix typo @zhao-oai\n  - #7629 fix(tui): add missing Ctrl+n/Ctrl+p support to ListSelectionView @pppp606\n  - #7634 fix: chat completion with parallel tool call @jif-oai\n  - #7638 fix: ignore ghost snapshots in token consumption @jif-oai\n  - #7645 Also load skills from repo root. @xl-openai\n  - #7648 Add remote models feature flag @aibrahim-oai\n  - #7651 fix: OTEL HTTP exporter panic and mTLS support @asm89\n  - #7652 Move justfile to repository root @joshka-oai\n  - #7653 proposing execpolicy amendment when prompting due to sandbox denial @zhao-oai\n  - #7654 fix: exec-server stream was erroring for large requests @bolinfest\n  - #7655 fix wrap behavior for long commands @zhao-oai\n  - #7660 Restore status header after stream recovery @joshka-oai\n  - #7665 docs: fix documentation of rmcp client flag @JaySabva\n  - #7669 fix(doc): TOML otel exporter example — multi-line inline table is invalid @448523760\n  - #7672 docs: Remove experimental_use_rmcp_client from config @JaySabva\n  - #7673 docs: point dev checks to just @voctory\n  - #7674 feat: linux codesign with sigstore @shijie-oai\n  - #7675 feat: windows codesign with Azure trusted signing @shijie-oai\n  - #7678 fix: clear out space on ubuntu runners before running Rust tests @bolinfest\n  - #7680 fix: ensure macOS CI runners for Rust tests include recent Homebrew fixes @bolinfest\n  - #7685 fix: refine the warning message and docs for deprecated tools config @gameofby\n  - #7705 fix: update URLs to use HTTPS in model migration prompts @rakleed\n  - #7709 Enhance model picker @aibrahim-oai\n  - #7711 Add formatting client version to the x.x.x style. @aibrahim-oai\n  - #7713 chore(deps): bump ts-rs from 11.0.1 to 11.1.0 in /codex-rs @dependabot[bot]\n  - #7714 chore(deps): bump derive_more from 2.0.1 to 2.1.0 in /codex-rs @dependabot[bot]\n  - #7715 chore(deps): bump insta from 1.43.2 to 1.44.3 in /codex-rs @dependabot[bot]\n  - #7716 chore(deps): bump wildmatch from 2.5.0 to 2.6.1 in /codex-rs @dependabot[bot]\n  - #7722 load models from disk and set a ttl and etag @aibrahim-oai\n  - #7724 Fixed regression for chat endpoint;

      "type": "release",
      "fullNotes": "## Features\n\n  - Threads and turns now include git info, current working directory, CLI version, source metadata, and propagate thread and turn IDs on every item and error. They emit new notifications for diffs, plan updates, token-usage changes, and compaction events. File-change items provide output deltas, and ImageView items render images inline.\n  - Review flow is enhanced with a detached review mode, explicit enter and exit events, review thread IDs, and review history remains visible after rollout filtering changes.\n  - Execution gains an experimental “exp” model, unified exec pruning to limit session bloat, per-run custom environment injection, policy-approved command bypass, and Windows protections that flag risky browser or URL launches. History lookup now works on Windows and WSL, and model selection honors use_model.\n  - Safety defaults improve via consolidated world-writable scanning and workspace-write enforcement of read-only .git directories. Sandbox assessment and approval flows align with trust policies.\n  - MCP and shell tooling add shell-tool MCP login support, explicit capability declaration, sandbox awareness, publication to npm, and MCP elicitations. The rmcp client is upgraded to 0.10.0 for modern notifications.\n  - Observability increases as command items expose process IDs and threads and turns emit token-usage and compaction events. Feedback metadata captures source information.\n  - Tooling and ops gain follow-up v2 in the app-server test client, new config management utilities, and refreshed approvals documentation and quickstart placement.\n\n ## Bug fixes\n\n  - PowerShell apply_patch parsing is corrected, and apply_patch tests now cover shell_command behavior.\n  - Sandbox assessment regression is fixed, policy-approved commands are honored, dangerous-command checks are tightened on Windows, and workspace-write enforces .git read-only.\n  - MCP startup tolerates missing type fields, stream error messages are clarified, and rmcp nix output hash issues are resolved.\n  - Delegate cancellation no longer hangs unified exec, early-exit sessions are cleaned up, and duplicate “waited” renderings are suppressed.\n  - recent_commits with limit zero now returns zero, and the NetBSD process-hardening build is unblocked.\n  - Review rollout filtering is disabled so history shows, approval presets respect workspace-write, /approvals trust detection is corrected, and sandbox command assessment edge cases are fixed.\n  - Compaction accounts for encrypted reasoning, handles token budgets accurately, and emits reliable token-usage and compaction events.\n  - TTY stdin is required, WSL clipboard paths are normalized, and stale conversations are dropped on /new to avoid conflicts.\n  - Custom prompt expansion with large pastes is fixed, example-config mistakes are corrected, and relative links and streamable_shell references are cleaned up. Upgrade messaging is corrected.\n  - Windows sandbox treats <workspace_root>/.git as read-only, and risky browser launches are flagged before execution.\n  - CLA allowlist now includes dependabot variants, and enterprises can skip upgrade checks and messages.\n  - Flaky tests are stabilized, session recycling is improved, and rollout session initialization surfaces errors for diagnosis.\n\n ## Maintenance\n\n  - Security and CI add cargo-audit and cargo-deny.

Multi-line input is now supported via Shift+Ctrl on terminal that support the Kitty protocol. Multi-line input is also supported in VSCode and its forks by running the /terminal-setup command (fixes https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/14) - Enabled non-interactive GHE logins by respecting the GHHOST environment variable for PAT and gh authentication modes (fixes https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/296) - Improved debug log collection convenience by adding a persistent loglevel option in ~/.copilot/config.

      "fullNotes": "- Removed the \"Windows support is experimental\" warning -- we've made some big strides in improving Windows support the last two weeks! Please continue to report any issues/feedback - Improved debugging by including the Copilot API request ID for model calls errors and stack traces for client errors - Fixed an issue where consecutive orphaned tool calls led to a \"Each tooluse block must have a corresponding toolresult block in the next message\" message (fixes https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/102) - Added a prompt to approve new paths in -p mode. Also added --allow-all-paths argument that approves access to all paths. - Changed parsing of environment variables in MCP server configuration to treat the value of the env section as literal values (fixes https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/26). Customers who have configured MCP Servers for use with the CLI will need to make a slight modification to their ~/.copilot/mcp-config.json. For any servers they have added with an env section, they will need to go add a $ to the start of the \"value\" pair of the key value pair of each entry in the env-block, so to have the values treated as references to environment variables. For example: Before: json { \"env\": { \"GITHUBACCESSTOKEN\": \"GITHUBTOKEN\" } } Before this change, the CLI would read the value of GITHUBTOKEN from the environment of the CLI and set the environment varaible named GITHUBACCESSTOKEN in the MCP process to that value. With this change, GITHUBACCESSTOKEN would now be set to the literal value GITHUBTOKEN. To get the old behavior, change to this: json { \"env\": { \"GITHUBACCESSTOKEN\": \"${GITHUBTOKEN}\" } } Run npm install -g @github/copilot@latest to update!",

When using --allow-tool and --deny-tool, you can now specify things like shell(npm run test:) to match any shell commands beginning with npm run test - Improved the copilot --resume interface with relative time display, session message count, (Fixes https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/97) Run npm install -g @github/copilot@latest to update!",
