(8864) Bug Fixes - Codex CLI subprocesses again inherit env vars like LDLIBRARYPATH/DYLDLIBRARYPATH to avoid runtime issues. As explained in 8945, failure to pass along these environment variables to subprocesses that expect them (notably GPU-related ones), was causing 10x+ performance regressions! Special thanks to @johnzfitch for the detailed investigation and write-up in 8945. (8951) - /review <instructions> in TUI/TUI2 now launches the review flow instead of sending plain text. (8823) - Patch approval “allow this session” now sticks for previously approved files. (8451) - Model upgrade prompt now appears even if the current model is hidden from the picker. (8802) - Windows paste handling now supports non-ASCII multiline input reliably. Special thanks to @occurrent laying the groundwork for this fix in 8021! (8774) - Git apply path parsing now handles quoted/escaped paths and /dev/null correctly to avoid misclassified changes. (8824) Documentation - App-server README now documents skills support and usage. (8853) - Skill-creator docs clarify YAML frontmatter formatting and quoting rules.

      "type": "release",
      "fullNotes": "## Features\n\n  - Threads and turns now include git info, current working directory, CLI version, source metadata, and propagate thread and turn IDs on every item and error. They emit new notifications for diffs, plan updates, token-usage changes, and compaction events. File-change items provide output deltas, and ImageView items render images inline.\n  - Review flow is enhanced with a detached review mode, explicit enter and exit events, review thread IDs, and review history remains visible after rollout filtering changes.\n  - Execution gains an experimental “exp” model, unified exec pruning to limit session bloat, per-run custom environment injection, policy-approved command bypass, and Windows protections that flag risky browser or URL launches. History lookup now works on Windows and WSL, and model selection honors use_model.\n  - Safety defaults improve via consolidated world-writable scanning and workspace-write enforcement of read-only .git directories. Sandbox assessment and approval flows align with trust policies.\n  - MCP and shell tooling add shell-tool MCP login support, explicit capability declaration, sandbox awareness, publication to npm, and MCP elicitations. The rmcp client is upgraded to 0.10.0 for modern notifications.\n  - Observability increases as command items expose process IDs and threads and turns emit token-usage and compaction events. Feedback metadata captures source information.\n  - Tooling and ops gain follow-up v2 in the app-server test client, new config management utilities, and refreshed approvals documentation and quickstart placement.\n\n ## Bug fixes\n\n  - PowerShell apply_patch parsing is corrected, and apply_patch tests now cover shell_command behavior.\n  - Sandbox assessment regression is fixed, policy-approved commands are honored, dangerous-command checks are tightened on Windows, and workspace-write enforces .git read-only.\n  - MCP startup tolerates missing type fields, stream error messages are clarified, and rmcp nix output hash issues are resolved.\n  - Delegate cancellation no longer hangs unified exec, early-exit sessions are cleaned up, and duplicate “waited” renderings are suppressed.\n  - recent_commits with limit zero now returns zero, and the NetBSD process-hardening build is unblocked.\n  - Review rollout filtering is disabled so history shows, approval presets respect workspace-write, /approvals trust detection is corrected, and sandbox command assessment edge cases are fixed.\n  - Compaction accounts for encrypted reasoning, handles token budgets accurately, and emits reliable token-usage and compaction events.\n  - TTY stdin is required, WSL clipboard paths are normalized, and stale conversations are dropped on /new to avoid conflicts.\n  - Custom prompt expansion with large pastes is fixed, example-config mistakes are corrected, and relative links and streamable_shell references are cleaned up. Upgrade messaging is corrected.\n  - Windows sandbox treats <workspace_root>/.git as read-only, and risky browser launches are flagged before execution.\n  - CLA allowlist now includes dependabot variants, and enterprises can skip upgrade checks and messages.\n  - Flaky tests are stabilized, session recycling is improved, and rollout session initialization surfaces errors for diagnosis.\n\n ## Maintenance\n\n  - Security and CI add cargo-audit and cargo-deny. GitHub Actions are updated to checkout v6 and upload-artifact v5. macOS 13 builds are dropped. A flaky Ubuntu variant is skipped. The next_minor_version script now resets the patch number correctly.\n  - Dependencies are updated: libc 0.2.177, webbrowser 1.0.6, regex 1.12.2, toml_edit 0.23.5, arboard 3.6.1, serde_with 3.16.1, image 0.25.9, reqwest 0.12.24, tracing 0.1.43, and rmcp 0.10.0.\n  - Documentation is refreshed: approvals and config guidance, codex max and xhigh defaults, example-config fixes, CLA guidance, and removal of streamable_shell references.\n\n## PRs Merged\n\n  - fix(scripts) next_minor_version should reset patch number by @dylan-hurd-oai in #7050\n  -

      "fullNotes": "- Removed the \"Windows support is experimental\" warning -- we've made some big strides in improving Windows support the last two weeks! Please continue to report any issues/feedback - Improved debugging by including the Copilot API request ID for model calls errors and stack traces for client errors - Fixed an issue where consecutive orphaned tool calls led to a \"Each tooluse block must have a corresponding toolresult block in the next message\" message (fixes https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/102) - Added a prompt to approve new paths in -p mode. Also added --allow-all-paths argument that approves access to all paths. - Changed parsing of environment variables in MCP server configuration to treat the value of the env section as literal values (fixes https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/26). Customers who have configured MCP Servers for use with the CLI will need to make a slight modification to their ~/.copilot/mcp-config.json. For any servers they have added with an env section, they will need to go add a $ to the start of the \"value\" pair of the key value pair of each entry in the env-block, so to have the values treated as references to environment variables. For example: Before: json { \"env\": { \"GITHUBACCESSTOKEN\": \"GITHUBTOKEN\" } } Before this change, the CLI would read the value of GITHUBTOKEN from the environment of the CLI and set the environment varaible named GITHUBACCESSTOKEN in the MCP process to that value. With this change, GITHUBACCESSTOKEN would now be set to the literal value GITHUBTOKEN. To get the old behavior, change to this: json { \"env\": { \"GITHUBACCESSTOKEN\": \"${GITHUBTOKEN}\" } } Run npm install -g @github/copilot@latest to update!",

(Addresses feedback of the discoverability of non-interactive mode from https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/96) - Changed the behavior of Ctrl+r to expand only recent timeline items. After running Ctrl+r, you can use Ctrl+e to expand all - Improved word motion logic to better detect newlines: using word motion keys will now correctly move to the first word on a line - Improved the handling of multi-line inputs in the input box: the input text box is scrollable, limited to 10 lines. Long prompts won't take up the whole screen anymore! (This is on the way to implementing https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/14) - Removed the left and right boarders from the input box. This makes it easier to copy text out of it! - Added glob matching to shell rules. When using --allow-tool and --deny-tool, you can now specify things like shell(npm run test:) to match any shell commands beginning with npm run test - Improved the copilot --resume interface with relative time display, session message count, (Fixes https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/97) Run npm install -g @github/copilot@latest to update!",
